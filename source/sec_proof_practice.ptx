  <title>Writing First Proofs</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
    Let's first look at a sample proof. We'll use a theorem (not
    labelled as such) from Hutchings's notes.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>For every integer <m>x</m>, if <m>x</m> is odd, then
      <m>x+1</m> is even.</p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>Let <m>x</m> be an odd integer. Then by the definition of odd
      integer, there exists an integer <m>k</m> such that
      <m>x=2k+1</m>. Now consider <m>x+1</m>. We may substitute
      <m>x=2k+1</m>, which gives
      <m>x+1 = (2k+1)+1</m>. Using algebra, we have
      <me>x+1 = (2k+1)+1 = 2k+2 = 2(k+1)</me>. Let <m>m=k+1</m>. Since
      <m>k</m> is an integer, <m>m</m> is also an integer. Thus, we
      have that <m>x+1=2m</m>, where <m>m</m> is an integer. This is
      exactly what it means for <m>x+1</m> to be even.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  </introduction>

      <statement>
	Prove the theorem <q>If <m>x</m> is an odd integer and
	<m>y</m> is an odd integer, then <m>xy</m> is an odd integer.</q>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>
	<p>Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>be odd integers. Hence there exist
	integers <m>k</m> and <m>n</m> such that <m>x=2k+1</m> and
	<m>y=2n+1</m>. Multiplying, we have
	<me>xy=(2k+1)(2n+1) = 4kn+2k+2n+1 = 2(2kn+k+n)+1</me>.
	Since <m>k</m> and <m>n</m> are integers, we know that
	<m>2kn+k+n</m> is an integer. Thus, we see that <m>xy</m> is
	an odd integer.
	</p>

	<p>(Note that it would be completely reasonable to do
	something like let <m>m=2kn+k+n</m> if you wanted to make the
	form of an odd integer clearer, but I think this proof would
	be fine as written.)</p>

  <statement>
    <p>Prove the theorem <q>For every integer <m>x</m>, <m>x+4</m> is
    odd if and only if <m>x+7</m> is even.</q> (Recall that this
    requires proving two separate implications. Identify them before
    writing your proofs!)</p>
  </statement>
  <!-- <solution>
    <p><m>(\Rightarrow)</m> Let <m>x+4</m> be an odd integer. Hence
    there exists an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>x+4=2n+1</m>. By
    adding three to both sides of this equation, we have <m>x+7 =
    2n+4</m>. Factoring the right-hand side gives <m>x+7 =
    2(n+2)</m>. Hence, since <m>x+7</m> is twice an integer, we have
    proved that <m>x+7</m> is even.</p>
    <p><m>(\Leftarrow)</m> Let <m>x+7</m> be an even integer. This
    means that there is an integer such that
    <m>x+7=2m</m>. Subtracting <m>3</m> from both sides gives
    <m>x+4=2m-3</m>. A bit more algebra shows that <m>x+4 = 2m-4+1 =
    2(m-2)+1</m>. Thus, we have proved that <m>x+4</m> is an odd integer.

      <p>Another type of theorem that we are sometimes called upon to
      prove is a <term>uniqueness theorem</term>. In such a case, we
      must prove that the thing in question exists as well as prove
      that there is only one such thing. The next activity walks you
      through the structure of such an argument.</p>
<activity workspace="5cm">
  <introduction>
    <p>We want to prove the theorem <q>If <m>c,a,r\in\mathbb{R}</m>
    such that <m>c\neq 0</m> and <m>r\neq a/c</m>, then there exists a
    unique <m>x\in\mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>(ax+1)/(cx) =
    r</m>.</q></p>
  </introduction>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>The first step in a uniqueness proof is to demonstrate that
      such a beast exists. One pattern for doing this is by coming up
      with a formula for the thing (here <m>x</m>) that we need to
      have exist and showing that <m>x</m> does what it's supposed
      to. <alert>The process of how you come with the <m>x</m> is
      scratchwork that doesn't go in the proof!</alert>. Thus, we want
      to start by finding a formula for <m>x</m> so that
      <m>(ax+1)/(cx) = r</m>. Use familiar algebra skills to do
      it. What you write up for your proof is going to look like
      <q>Let <m>x=\cdots</m>. Now substituting and simplifying, we
      see:</q> starting with <m>(ax+1)/(cx)</m> and simplifying to get
      <m>r</m>.</p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>Next, we have to show that our <m>x</m> is unique. To do so,
      you assume that <m>x_1,x_2\in\mathbb{R}</m> both have the
      property required. Namely, that  <m>(ax_1+1)/(cx_1) =
    r</m> and <m>(ax_2+1)/(cx_2) =
    r</m>. Now you use algebra to show that <m>x_1=x_2</m>, which
      means that the <m>x</m> you came up with originally really is unique.</p>
    </statement>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>What you have above likely has a lot of scratchwork in
      it. Rewrite things neatly to have a nice paragraph that proves
      the theorem.</p>
